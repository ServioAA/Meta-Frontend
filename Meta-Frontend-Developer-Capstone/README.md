#Little Lemon Booking Website
##Project Overview
The Little Lemon Booking Website is a project developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course. It represents the final project in the Front-End Development track and demonstrates the practical application of the concepts learned.

Project Description
The website serves as a booking platform for the Little Lemon restaurant. Built using React, it highlights the creation and management of React components to develop an interactive and dynamic user interface. The site includes API integrations to handle data operations effectively.

While the design of the website is fully functional, the primary operational feature currently available is the "Reserve a Table" functionality, which allows users to book tables at the restaurant..
